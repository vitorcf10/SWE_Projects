# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Description

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an application that allows users to interactively visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are essential for organizing data efficiently. This project aims to make these algorithms more accessible and understandable by providing a visual representation of how they work.
<\n>Personal goals:
- Get a better understanding of sorting algorithms while coding the application.
- Develop my own coding skills.
- Study software engineering concepts and ideas.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms step by step.
- Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort).
- Control the array you want to sort.
- Change the color palette and visualization.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Installation

To set up the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vitorcf10/SWE_Projects/Sorting_Algos_Visualizer.git

2. Clone the repository:
- Have python3 installed

3. Install pygame:
   
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

4. If pip does not work, try:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pygame

## Usage

1. Simply run the sort_visualizer.py file with your IDE of choice, or:
      ```bash
   python3 sort_visualizer.py

2. Once the user runs, the application has the following options:
- Press SPACE: Start to sort the array using the algorithm in the current title.
- Press R: Reset the array to a new random array.
- Press A: Sort in ascending order.
- Press D: Sort in descending order.
- Press P: Use the array set the last time SPACE was pressed.
- Press I: Choose insertion sort as the sorting algorithm.
- Press B: Choose bubble sort as the sorting algorithm.
- Press S: Choose selection sort as the sorting algorithm.
- Press C: Choose shell sort as the sorting algorithm.
- Press W: Choose the default/white color palette.
- Press X: Choose the dark color palette.
- Press Y: Choose the Google color palette.
- Press Z: Choose the ocean color palette.
- Click the 'X' at the top right corner to exit.
